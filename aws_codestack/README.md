We need some good beginner content which we can leverage off. 
The self created youtube videos are too general and are for specific cases which are generally useless for building experience in the basic components

Need First S3 and EC2 with roles, networking, logging, security. The configuraiton and monitoring is more complex than the application. 

Then we need containers and lambda for microservices. We need testing at scale for 10x the expected load.

2 stages, source and deploy stage
Actions in stages
Providers in Actions in stages
running a buildspec. copy code from github and run

Code Pipelien actions and providers
devops deployment pipeline build-test-release
2 key points
1) faster you can get through deployment pipeline and feedback look determines
how responsive you can be to your customers
2) only delivering value if you are spending time on developing new features

we want to minimize teh time we spend in the loop

effective culture: 
3 types of organizations, pathologica, bureaucratic, generative. 

traditional teams: 100 different teams, gates when there is an integration error. once code complete 4-6 weeks working w separate systems team to deploy?
